Problem 1 \\
Two summers ago, I implemented an n-dimensional Markov Chain which eventually converged to its stationary distribution when $n$ was high enough and I also verified this by finding the stationary distribution of the Markov Chain. In addition, I also created a four page reference sheet for linear algebra here https://github.com/dannykliu/reference-sheets/blob/master/linear-algebra.pdf. \\

Problem 2 \\
1) In spherical coordinates $r = 1$ expresses the unit sphere. \\
2) In cylindrical coordinates $r^2 + z^2 = 1$ also express the unit sphere.
